# Syntax Convertor
A UI that provides developers useful utilities to convert their CSS to the useful CSS pre-processor like (LESS or STYLUS) or to convert HTML to JSX or JADE. [Demo](https://hadijaveed.github.io/All-Convertors/)

### Motivation
The intent is to create a one stop UI to do syntax conversion of the Front-End code for the developers. As of today developers have to search for different places to convert their CSS, HTML or JS code to the different syntax or they have to install local CLI tools to do the conversion. All-Convertors is the project they can run locally or can go to Github Hosted [URL](https://hadijaveed.github.io/All-Convertors/) to do the necessary conversions they like.


### Work in progress
1. Other css pre-processors like SASS and SCSS.
2. JS to coffee script.
3. ES(next) to ES5 conversions.
4. Fix sloppy CSS editor when the file size grows to 1000 lines.
5. Add copy to clipboard feature.
6. Write necessary Unit Test Cases.
